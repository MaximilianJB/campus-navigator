# Campus Navigator

A web-based application that helps students, faculty, and visitors find the fastest or most convenient routes across campus. Campus Navigator leverages a grid-based or obstacle-based approach for pathfinding, providing accurate navigation around buildings and open walkways.

## Features
- **Map Data**: Uses building footprints and campus layout data to mark blocked zones.
- **Pathfinding**: Implements A* (and potential optimizations) for route calculation.
- **User-Friendly UI**: A mobile-compatible, map-based interface for selecting start/end points.
- **API-Driven**: Routes are requested from a dedicated API, ensuring a clean separation between frontend and backend.
